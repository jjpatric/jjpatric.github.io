# One more time
There is this idea that keeps coming up as I continue my language learning journey. 
It is this: 

**Your motivation behind learning the language is everything.**
It will determine how far you go, how long you last, how much you can do. 
Without the proper motivation your aspirations will fizzle out and die.
Today I found was questioning myself again on why.

For french my motivation is clear: 
- It is the official second language of my country. 
- I know many people who speak french some of whom are family.
- knowing french will expand my opportunities immensely.
- I want to experience french canada.
- the list goes on.

However, for Japanese I do not feel as confident in my motivation. 
If someone were to ask I would say:
- My sister plans to move there in the future and when I visit her I want to surprise everyone with how well I speak japanese.
- I want to be like in the guy in this video: [White Guy Stuns Entire Supermarket With Flawless Japanese](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMBhj5WGeaI)

I will continue this post later...
