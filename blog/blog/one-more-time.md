# One more time
There is this one idea that keeps coming up as I continue my language learning journey. 
It is this: 

**Your motivation behind learning the language is everything.**
It will determine how far you go, how long you last, how much you can do. 
Without the proper motivation your aspirations will fizzle out and die.

For french my motivation is practical: 
- It is the official second language of my country. 
- I know many people who speak french some of whom are family.
- Knowing french will expand my opportunities immensely.
- I have already spent years studying in school.

However, for Japanese my motivations are abstract. 
- I find the culture fascinating.
- I want to be like in the guy in this video: [White Guy Stuns Entire Supermarket With Flawless Japanese](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMBhj5WGeaI)

Strangely I find myself more drawn to learn Japanese when given the choice. When I open youtube and there is a mix of French and Japanese content I find myself wanting to always pick the japanese content. It takes effort to choose a french video.

This made me realise that the real motivation behind learning any second language at all is the desire to do something fun, while exposing myself to something new.
